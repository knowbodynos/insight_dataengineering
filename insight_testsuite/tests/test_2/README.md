This test includes as input a sample from the over 24 million pharmaceutical records provided at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fxtTLR_Z5fTO-Y91BnKOQd6J0VC9gPO3/view?usp=sharing, and includes a strange case in which the drug name contains a comma (i.e. the field delimiter). The output was generated by running the code once in standalone mode. Although this does not confirm whether the output is correct, it confirms that the code is still working as it did during that benchmark run.
